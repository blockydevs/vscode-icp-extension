#  VSCODE MOTOKO
## Overview

This Visual Studio Code extension provides a specialized Language Server to help developers working with `dfx.json` files. The main features of this extension include:

- **Autocomplete**: Helps users by suggesting possible completions for their input based on the schema.
- **Validation**: Checks the `dfx.json` file against the provided schema and highlights any errors or inconsistencies.

These features are powered by a schema located in `/server/dfx.json`.

- **Canisters View**: A visual representation of the `dfx.json` file in a tree format, allowing easy navigation and interaction with canisters. The extension is activated from the side panel of Visual Studio Code.
- **Canister Actions**: For each canister, you can perform various actions such as deploying the canister. You can also perform actions on all canisters collectively.

### Key Files and Directories

- **client/extension.ts**: Responsible for starting the client and registering commands.
- **server/server.ts**: Entry point for the Language Server, where the server is configured and started.
- **package.json**: Contains metadata about the extension, including dependencies, activation events, and contributions to VS Code.
- **modules/**: Contains helper modules for commands, global variables, dfx json provider, logs and replica management.
- **tools/ui/**: Contains Candid UI source code acquired from [Dfinity Candid Implementation](https://github.com/dfinity/candid) with our changes for better visual experience in Visual Studio Code.

## How to Run

To get started with the extension, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the root directory to install all necessary npm modules for the client, server and tools/ui packages.

2. **Build the project**:
   - Run `npm run build` to build project and put sources of client and server to target directory `build` and also build necessary Candid UI packages.

3. **Launch the extension**:
   - Switch to the Run and Debug View in the Sidebar (`Ctrl+Shift+D`).
   - Select `Launch Extension` from the dropdown menu.
   - Press `â–·` (or `F5`) to run the launch configuration.

4. **Test the extension**:
   - In the new instance of VS Code that opens (known as the Extension Development Host), open a document with a `.json` extension.
   - You should see validation errors and autocomplete suggestions specific to `dfx.json` files.
   - You can also start local replica, deploy canisters based on `dfx.json` definitions and by selecting option of deploying Candid UI 
   also launch Candid UI for selected canister in webview.

## Using `dfx` with WSL in Visual Studio Code

To use `dfx` with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. **Install and Set Up WSL:**

   Ensure you have WSL installed and set up on your system. Follow the [official Microsoft guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you haven't done this yet.

2. **Install `dfx` in WSL:**

   Open your WSL terminal and install `dfx` according to the [Internet Computer documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/install/).

3. **Open Visual Studio Code:**

   Open Visual Studio Code on your Windows machine.

4. **Connect to WSL:**

   - Click on the green remote connection icon in the bottom left corner of the VS Code window.
   - Select `Connect to WSL` from the dropdown menu.
   - Choose your WSL distribution if prompted.

5. **Access `dfx` commands in VS Code:**

   Once connected to WSL, you will be able to run `dfx` commands directly from the integrated terminal in VS Code.

   - Open a new terminal in VS Code by clicking on `Terminal` in the top menu and selecting `New Terminal`.
   - Check `dfx --version` to verify the installation.
