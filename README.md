#  VSCODE MOTOKO
## Overview

This Visual Studio Code extension provides a specialized Language Server to help developers working with `dfx.json` files. The main features of this extension include:

- **Autocomplete**: Helps users by suggesting possible completions for their input based on the schema.
- **Validation**: Checks the `dfx.json` file against the provided schema and highlights any errors or inconsistencies.

These features are powered by a schema located in `/server/src/dfx.json`.

- **Canisters View**: A visual representation of the `dfx.json` file in a tree format, allowing easy navigation and interaction with canisters. The extension is activated from the side panel of Visual Studio Code.
- **Canister Actions**: For each canister, you can perform various actions such as deploying the canister. You can also perform actions on all canisters collectively.
- **Options Section**: Provides additional options for managing the `dfx.json` file and the related canisters.

### Key Files and Directories

- **client/src/extension.ts**: Responsible for starting the client and registering commands.
- **server/src/server.ts**: Entry point for the Language Server, where the server is configured and started.
- **package.json**: Contains metadata about the extension, including dependencies, activation events, and contributions to VS Code.
- **modules/**: Contains helper modules for commands, global variables, project management, and replica management.

## How to Run

To get started with the extension, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the root directory to install all necessary npm modules for both the client and server.

2. **Compile the project**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to start compiling the client and server in watch mode. This will automatically recompile the project whenever you make changes.

3. **Launch the extension**:
   - Switch to the Run and Debug View in the Sidebar (`Ctrl+Shift+D`).
   - Select `Launch Client` from the dropdown menu.
   - Press `â–·` (or `F5`) to run the launch configuration.

4. **Test the extension**:
   - In the new instance of VS Code that opens (known as the Extension Development Host), open a document with a `.json` extension.
   - You should see validation errors and autocomplete suggestions specific to `dfx.json` files.

## Example Use Cases

The extension comes with several built-in commands to manage and interact with `dfx.json` and related development tasks. These commands are executed through the context menu in the Canisters View.

`options`:
